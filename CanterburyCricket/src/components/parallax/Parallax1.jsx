    Canterbury Cricket Club — Where Passion Meets the Pitch

  <p>
    Canterbury Cricket Club is a proud <strong>cricket club in Ottawa</strong> with a legacy built through competitive
    cricket and strong community values. Founded in its modern form in <strong>1983</strong>, the club has helped shape
    <strong> Ottawa cricket</strong> for decades — from historic roots to today’s growing game, including{" "}
    <strong>leather ball cricket</strong> and league competitions.
  </p>

  <p>
    Canterbury Cricket Club Ottawa traces its roots back more than four decades, with its modern identity officially
    beginning in <strong>1983</strong>. Before that, the club was known as the{" "}
    <strong>Canadian Forces Ottawa Cricket Club (CFOCC)</strong> — fondly called <em>Forces</em> — and was based out of
    the Uplands military grounds.
  </p>

  <p>
    By 1982, a combination of retirements and an unfortunate incident led to a decline in membership, leaving Forces CC
    on the brink of folding. At the same time, another neighbouring club, <strong>Levenoques Cricket Club</strong>, based
    in Hillcrest, was facing similar struggles. Rather than allowing two historic Ottawa clubs to disappear, the
    leadership and players of both sides chose unity over loss. Forces CC was one of the most successful and respected
    clubs in the Ottawa Valley Cricket Council, producing championship teams and some of the greatest cricketers the city
    has ever seen.
  </p>

  <p>
    Legends of Ottawa cricket such as{" "}
    <strong>
      Jim Siew, Tariq Javed, Gullu Bajwa, Tony Edwards, Clinton Calixte, Shahid Khan, Mumtaz Akhter, and Akhter Mufti
    </strong>{" "}
    proudly wore the Forces colours, helping build a legacy of excellence, discipline, and sportsmanship that still
    defines the club today.
  </p>

  <p>
    With overwhelming support from both memberships, Forces CC and Levenoques CC merged to form a new club. Because both
    teams played within the Canterbury ward, the newly united club was proudly named <strong>Canterbury Cricket Club</strong>.
    A new home was assigned at <strong>Lynda Lane</strong>, a ground that was transformed into a playable cricket field
    through the dedication, labour, and commitment of Canterbury players themselves.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, Canterbury Cricket Club continues to grow the game in Ottawa — welcoming new players and experienced cricketers
    who want competitive matches, strong team culture, and respect for cricket traditions. 🏏
